    "- In other words, the keys of the dictionary are the interests, and the data of each key is a list. This list is itself formed by several lists, each of these smaller lists giving the information for a particular scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the information of those scientits who have that particular interest will enter that particular key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As an example, lets say the results are as follows. Scientist A1 with affiliation B1 has interests X1 and X2, while scientist A2 with affiliation B2 has interests X2 and X3. Then, the complete dictionary is `results={X1: [[A1, B1, \"X1, X2\"]], X2: [[A1, B1, \"X1, X2\"],[A2, B2, \"X2, X3\"]], X3: [[A2, B2, \"X2, X3\"]]}`\n",

    "\n",
    "- In each file, the first row will have the headers \"Name, Affiliation\", etc, and each of the subsequent rows will consist of the details of the scientists. Each scientist will occupy one complete row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The delimiter has been chosen to be `'\\t'`, because comma is pretty common in the text."
